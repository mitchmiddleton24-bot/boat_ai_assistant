JOB 1 – FIELD NOTES AND DAILY LOG  
Project: Westshore Breakwall Repair  
Contractor: Remain Marine Services  
Date Range: Nov 20 – Nov 27  

SUMMARY OF WORK COMPLETED  
This week focused on the final demolition of the damaged concrete section near the east tie-in point, installation of new rebar cages, preparation for the first concrete pour, and staging of riprap for shoreline stabilization. The barge-mounted crane operated all week without mechanical issues aside from a brief hydraulic warning light on Tuesday. Weather conditions were mixed—temperatures in the low 30s, light snow accumulation Wednesday, and two days of high winds that forced early shutdowns.

CREW ACTIVITY NOTES  
The crew performed well overall, though productivity varied depending on wind conditions and material delivery timing. Chad and Evan completed demolition of the old concrete faster than expected and transitioned early to forming the rebar cages. The new hire, Blake, still needs additional training on rigging safety; he twice connected shackles incorrectly before being corrected by Evan. No injuries were reported. Crew morale is good—Thanksgiving week slowed things down but the team maintained momentum.

MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT NOTES  
Rebar shipment from Great Lakes Steel arrived Tuesday noon—one pallet damaged on the lower corner, but still usable. Concrete forms delivered on Thursday.  
The barge crane ran normally except for a brief low-pressure hydraulic alarm Tuesday morning that cleared after a restart. Crew believes it was due to cold oil. Daily greasing logs were completed as required. Generator #2 tripped twice when both heaters and the air compressor were running simultaneously; likely an overload issue.

SAFETY NOTES  
PPE compliance has been strong. Life jackets worn at all times on the barge. The primary concern this week involved icy conditions on the lower deck Wednesday morning—salt was applied and the deck was cleared before work resumed. Continue reminding crew to slow down movement on cold-weather mornings.

SCHEDULE NOTES  
Demolition completed one day early relative to projected timeline. Rebar cage installation is approximately 75 percent complete. Concrete pour #1 is tentatively scheduled for Monday morning if overnight temps remain above 28 degrees. Forecast shows potential snow Monday afternoon but pour window should be acceptable.

DELIVERY AND LOGISTICS NOTES  
Riprap delivery from Harper Trucking was delayed twice—first due to truck maintenance, second due to a backup at the quarry. Final load arrived Friday at 3:40 PM.  
Concrete supplier reconfirmed Monday delivery at 7:30 AM.  
Fuel delivery is needed by Wednesday; tank currently at 32 percent.

CLIENT/INSPECTOR INTERACTION  
City inspector visited site Tuesday at 10 AM. He noted good progress and mentioned the city wants photographic documentation of all rebar installation. Evan will handle photos Monday morning before the pour. Inspector asked for updated schedule by Wednesday.

PROBLEMS, RISKS, AND NOTES  
Wind delays remain the biggest variable for schedule. Crew has been shutting down the crane at gusts above 28 mph.  
There is a small risk of concrete temperature issues; consider using heated blankets if the nighttime low drops into the teens.  
Communication with Harper Trucking needs improvement—recommend requiring morning confirmations for all heavy material deliveries.

GENERAL FEEDBACK  
Crew is settling into a steady rhythm. Equipment condition is good. Safety is acceptable but continuous monitoring is needed with cold weather approaching. Overall production is on track for this stage of the project.
