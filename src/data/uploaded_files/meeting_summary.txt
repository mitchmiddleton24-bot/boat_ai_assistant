WEEKLY OPERATIONS MEETING TRANSCRIPT – CONDENSED NOTES  
Company: Remain Marine Services  
Date: November 26  
Attendees: Mitch, Jacob, Mark (Foreman), Sarah (Office Manager), Tim (Estimator), and contractors from Harper Trucking and Great Lakes Steel.

MEETING START – 8:05 AM  
Mitch opened the meeting by laying out the primary objective: reviewing progress on active shoreline and marina repair projects, identifying delays, and planning material and labor allocation for the upcoming two-week window. The team acknowledged that cold temperatures and unpredictable lake conditions will constrain work for at least the next month, so planning accuracy is critical.

FOREMAN PROJECT UPDATES  
Mark reported on the Westshore Breakwall project first. He stated demolition is now fully complete and rebar cage installation is at approximately 75 percent. He confirmed that the crew intends to complete the final tie-in work by late Tuesday, assuming concrete Supplier #1 remains on schedule. Mark emphasized two concerns. First, the riprap delivery delays from Harper Trucking compressed the staging schedule. Second, new crew member Blake needs additional hands-on rigging training to ensure he meets safety standards. Mitch agreed and said he will pair Blake with Evan for two days next week as part of a structured onboarding plan.

Mark then moved to the Lakeside Marina dredging project. Weather created significant delays with wave heights exceeding safe levels Monday and Thursday. The dredge pump clogged twice due to foreign debris—apparently from discarded dock hardware that settled earlier in the season. Crew spent four hours clearing and resetting the system. Tim asked whether underwater imaging equipment could be brought in to identify buried obstructions ahead of time. Mitch said it would be ideal but not within the current budget unless delays continue.

VENDOR REPORTS  
A representative from Harper Trucking spoke next, acknowledging the delays on riprap delivery. He explained that their primary trailer for oversized rock loads blew a tire Monday morning, and their secondary trailer was already committed. Mitch stressed that delays have a cascading effect on scheduling crane time and asked Harper to implement a same-day confirmation process. Harper agreed to begin sending 7 AM confirmation texts to the foreman.

Great Lakes Steel rep provided an update on upcoming rebar orders. He said the mill is running slightly behind due to holiday week staffing. However, Remain Marine’s next shipment is still expected to leave the yard on Thursday, arriving no later than Monday afternoon. Mitch requested photos of the loading pallet so they can verify nothing is damaged this time.

ESTIMATING AND FINANCIAL NOTES  
Tim presented cost and production data. Westshore Breakwall is trending slightly under budget due to demolition finishing faster than projected. However, crane time on Lakeside Marina has been higher than anticipated due to weather shutdowns and debris removal. Tim recommended submitting a change order request to the city to cover the additional man-hours spent clearing blockages. Mitch said they need photographic evidence of the debris to justify the request—Mark confirmed he has photos from Thursday.

Tim also discussed upcoming bid opportunities, including a shoreline stabilization project in Spring Lake and a small commercial marina expansion in Muskegon. He asked whether the company could handle simultaneous early-spring mobilizations. Mitch said yes, as long as equipment maintenance is completed by mid-February and subcontractor availability is confirmed. Sarah emphasized that vendor credit limits need to be increased before spring, given material price increases.

SAFETY DISCUSSION  
Mitch moved the conversation to safety. Weekly safety review showed good compliance overall, but cold-weather slips are rising across the industry. Sarah suggested adding temporary non-slip mats on the barge deck. Mark said storage space is limited but they could cut mats to half-size and place them near high-traffic areas. Mitch approved the purchase of six mats.

Training concerns focused again on Blake. Mitch emphasized that a new hire making two rigging mistakes in one week is concerning. Mark will oversee a half-day refresher on shackle alignment, tag-line usage, and crane communication protocols.

EQUIPMENT AND MAINTENANCE  
Jason from mechanical services joined remotely to discuss equipment status. Crane hydraulic pressure alarm on Tuesday was likely caused by cold thickened oil. He recommended switching to winter-grade hydraulic fluid and checking system pressure Monday morning before the concrete pour. Mitch asked him to send a technician Friday morning to perform the fluid swap.

Generator #2 overloads were discussed. Sarah confirmed that both heaters and the compressor running simultaneously exceed its rated surge capacity. Mitch approved purchasing a compact secondary heater unit to reduce load.

SCHEDULING AND FORECASTING  
Mitch pulled up the two-week forecast that showed moderate temperatures but recurring lake-effect snow risks. Concrete pour #1 at Westshore is tentatively Monday at 7:30 AM. If temps drop below 28 degrees, insulated blankets will be required. Mitch asked Sarah to order six additional thermal blankets.

Lakeside Marina dredging is tentatively scheduled to resume Wednesday morning, with wave height forecasts looking acceptable. Crew rotation plans were discussed—Mark wants to place Chad on dredge duty and have Evan remain with the concrete crew.

PROCUREMENT AND OFFICE ITEMS  
Sarah brought up invoicing delays caused by late timesheet submissions. Mitch told Mark to ensure the crew submits daily logs digitally by 6 PM. She also mentioned vendor credit accounts may need limit increases ahead of spring. Mitch asked her to assemble a vendor credit overview by next Monday.

CLIENT RELATIONS  
Mitch summarized the city inspector’s comments. Inspector is happy with progress but emphasized the need for documented photos of rebar installation before pouring concrete. Mark agreed to take photos Monday morning. Mitch reminded everyone that strong documentation reduces disputes later.

MEETING CLOSE  
Mitch summarized action items:  
- Implement daily 7 AM material confirmation with Harper Trucking  
- Complete rigging safety training for Blake  
- Swap crane hydraulic fluid to winter grade  
- Order non-slip mats and thermal blankets  
- Prepare change order request for dredging debris delays  
- Improve daily log submission consistency  
- Verify vendor credit limits before spring mobilization  

Meeting adjourned at 9:32 AM.
